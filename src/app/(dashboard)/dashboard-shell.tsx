  // 2026-08-07 (parte 31) — found via Safari Web Inspector connected
  // live to the iPhone (Develop → device), not hypothesis: focusing the
  // Inbox composer's `<textarea>` sets `document.documentElement
  // .scrollTop` to a nonzero value (measured: 354px) via iOS's native
  // "scroll the focused input into view" behavior. That's a different
  // code path from CSS-overflow-driven scrolling — confirmed neither
  // `html`/`body`'s `overflow: hidden` (globals.css, parte 24) nor
  // locking `<main>` (inbox/page.tsx, parte 28) stops it, because
  // neither of those elements is the one actually being scrolled; it's
  // `<html>` itself (`document.scrollingElement`), one level above both.
  // `--app-height`'s own math was independently confirmed correct at
  // the same moment (composer's real bottom edge exactly matched the
  // live-shrunk viewport, zero overflow) — this was purely a scroll-
  // position bug, not a sizing one. Fixed reactively: snap
  // `document.scrollingElement.scrollTop` back to 0 the instant it
  // moves, rather than trying to block it via CSS (doesn't work) or via
  // a broad `scrollTo` on every `visualViewport.resize` (tried in parte
  // 17, reverted in parte 18 — at the time it fought a height
  // adjustment the composer still needed; that need is gone now that
  // the height math is confirmed correct on its own).

    // Height: `var(--app-height, 100dvh)`. This line has been fought
    // over across many sessions (partes 13-16, 25-27) chasing a moving
    // target — `dvh` (and the `window.innerHeight` it tracks) has been
    // measured, on the *same real device*, at both 932 (the true full
    // screen) and 873 (59px short) minutes apart with no keyboard
    // involved. No static CSS formula built from `dvh` can be correct
    // in both states, because the correct answer genuinely differs
    // between them — every fix in that range "worked" for whichever
    // measurement motivated it and broke for the next one.
    // `window.outerHeight`, by contrast, has read 932 in *every* real-
    // device measurement taken across this project's history — the one
    // stable signal. `use-app-height.ts` sets `--app-height` from
    // `outerHeight` at rest, and switches to live `visualViewport.height`
    // tracking the moment a text field is focused (via `focusin`, not by
    // inferring keyboard state from the height number itself — that
    // inference is exactly what isn't reliable here). Only active in
    // real standalone-PWA use; a no-op on desktop or a regular Safari
    // tab, where the `100dvh` fallback is unchanged from before.
    //
    // Deliberately NOT CSS-`transition`ed: tried once (parte 33) to
    // smooth out `--app-height`'s JS-driven updates, but it made the
    // motion worse, not better — a CSS transition eases toward whatever
    // the *latest* JS-set target is from wherever it currently sits, so
    // each new `visualViewport` resize event mid-keyboard-animation
    // restarts/retargets it, producing a visibly separate animation
    // chasing the real keyboard instead of matching it. Snapping
    // straight to each reported value, however many times it fires,
    // tracks the keyboard's own live position more faithfully than a
    // second, independently-timed animation ever can. Reverted.
