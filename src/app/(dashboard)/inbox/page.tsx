            `min-w-0` is load-bearing — same bug class as the thread
            panel below (issue #165), confirmed live via Safari Web
            Inspector (2026-08-12) by walking the ancestor chain from an
            overflowing message preview: this exact div was the one
            that jumped from the real 430px screen width to ~2330px.
            Below `lg:`, this is a `flex-1`/`flex-basis:0%` item — without
            `min-w-0` its automatic minimum size falls back to its
            content's intrinsic width, and a long unbroken preview deep
            inside `ConversationList` (last_message_text, no wrap) was
            that content. Every truncation fix inside conversation-list.tsx
            was layered on top of a still-oversized ancestor, so none of
            them could actually take effect. At `lg:` this div switches to
            `flex-none` and stops needing to shrink at all — which is
            exactly why the bug only ever showed up on mobile widths,
            never on desktop. The same overflow also pushed the unread
            badge (the list row's rightmost column) off-screen past the
            visible viewport — it was never failing to render, just
            invisible past the right edge. */}
